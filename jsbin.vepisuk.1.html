// Keeping Up With JavaScripts- Part1: ES6 @HomeWork Assignment#2: Variables and Constants

// DEFINATION: In programming, a VARIABLE is a container which stores a value such as data or information.


/* 
   Important Points to remember about good old VARIABLES::

   1. VARIABLES are denoted by a keyword "var".
   2. VARIABLES are created with a descriptive name.
   3. VARIABLES can be declared without assigning a value @which outputs undefined when logged to the console. 
   4. VARIABLES are used to store or update information
   5. VARIABLES are used for reference or "get" information. 
   6. VARIABLE NAMES cannot start with numbers and are Case Sensitive. 
   7. VARIABLE NAMES cannot be the same as Reserved Keywords.
*/

// Up untill now, the only way to declare a variable in JavaScript was to use the keyword VAR. 
     //   Example using VAR keyword: 
                var myName = "Sasi"; // Stored a value of "Sasi" in myName variable.
                console.log(myName); // "Sasi"
                    myName = "Shashi"; // Updated the myName variable with a new value "Shashi".  
                console.log(myName); // "Shashi"

                var myAge = 35; // Stored a number value 35 in myAge variable.
                console.log(myAge); // 35

                var isMarried = true; // Assigned a boolean value true to isMarried variable. 
                console.log(isMarried); // true

// Introducing the LET keyword, a brand new Variable in ES6 or ES2015. 
/*   
   1. Variables declared with LET can be reassigned, but can't be redeclared in the same scope.
   2. Use LET to declare variables when there is a plan on changing the value of a variable later in the program.
  */ 
   // Example using LET keyword:
          let instructor = "Pirple"; // Declared a LET variable instructor and Assigned a value "Pirple". 
              instructor = "Pirple.thinkific"; // Reassigned a new value "Pirple.thinkific" without using LET keyword again.
              console.log(instructor); // "Pirple.thinkific"
   // Example using LET keyword without assigning a value. 
          let price; // No value assigned
          console.log(price); // undefined
          price = 100; // Value assigned later 
          console.log(price); // 100


// Introducing the CONST keyword, short for CONSTANT, another brand new and powerful Variable in ES6 OR ES2015.
/*
  1. Variables declared with CONST must be assigned an initial value, but can't be reassigned and redeclared in the same scope.
  2. Use CONST when there is NO plan on changing the value of a variable later in the program. 
  3. Since CONST is the strictest way to declare a variable, it is usually recommended to declare variables with CONST.
  4. CONST variable makes the code easier to reason about since the identifiers won't change throughout the lifetime of the program.  
*/
  // Example using CONST keyword: 
           const myLocation = "London"; // Once declared with CONST variable, the value can't be reassigned nor redeclared. 
           console.log(myLocation); // "London"

  /* What happens when CONST variable is used to reassign a new value:
           const occupation = "developer";
           console.log(occupation); // "developer"
                 occupation = "freelancer"; // reassign a new value
           console.log(occupation); // Throws  an uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
   */

   /* What happens when CONST variable is used without assigning a value:
           const education;
           console.log(education); // Syntax Error
   */


// Differences between VAR, LET and CONST and their appropriate usages using different use cases:

// In most cases, using VAR should be fine but sometimes it can get us into trouble like in the following example
     // VAR troubles Example:
               function getClothing(isCold) {
                 if (isCold) {
                   var freezing = "Wear a wool coat";
                 } else {
                   var hot = "Wear cotton clothes";
                   console.log(freezing);
                 }
               }
                 getClothing(false); // undefined

  /* Here, the function getClothing outputs UNDEFINED because of the JavaScript quirk called HOISTING and what the hell was that? 
     Well, HOISTING is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to top of their scope before
     code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the 
     top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.  
     
     In simple terms, Hoisting is JavaScript's default behaviour of moving declarations to the top.
     
     According to the Oxford english dictionary, The word HOISTING means raising, up lifting or elavating etc. 
  */

// So, at run-time, the above VAR troubles Example will look like this....
                function getClothing(isCold) {
                  var freezing, hot; // variables are raised to the top of the function scope at run-time
                  if (isCold) {
                    freezing = "Wear a wool coat";
                  } else {
                    hot = "Wear cotton clothes";
                   console.log(freezing);
                  }
                }
                 getClothing(false);  // undefined 

/* In order to combat this problem, smart developers developed new variable declarations namely, LET and CONST in ES6 to eliminate 
   this specific issue of HOISTING because they are scoped to the block, not to the function. Whereas, when used with VAR keyword, 
   variables were either scoped globally or locally to an entire function scope. */

// Replacing VAR keyword with LET variable in the above VAR troubles Example

                 function getClothing(isCold) {
                 if (isCold) {
                   let freezing = "Wear a wool coat"; 
                   /* Variable declared with LET keyword will stuck in what is known as 
                      TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE (TDZ) untill the variable's declaration is processed. */
                 } else {
                   let hot = "Wear cotton clothes";
                   console.log(freezing);
                 }
               }
                 getClothing(false); // Throws a reference error bcuz freezing is not defined anywhere. 


// Replacing VAR keyword with CONST variable in the above VAR troubles Example

                 function getClothing(isCold) {
                 if (isCold) {
                   const freezing = "Wear a wool coat"; 
                   } else {
                   const hot = "Wear cotton clothes";
                   console.log(freezing);
                 }
               }
                 getClothing(false); // Throws a reference error bcuz freezing is not defined anywhere.  

/* The major difference between using "VAR" and "LET" to declare a variable in JavaScript is Scoping. VAR is scoped to the 
   nearest function block and LET is scoped to the nearest enclosing block, which can be smaller than a functional block. 
   Both are global if outside any block. Also, variables declared with LET are not accessible before they are declared in
   their enclosing block.
